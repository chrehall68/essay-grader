# Essay Grader
Ever wonder how good your college essay is but not have anyone on-hand to give feedback for it?
Well, you're in luck. The essay grader AI will take your essay and output, on a scale
of 0% to 100%, how likely it is to get you into college. Trained (todo) on real essays that
made it in to college (and real essays that failed), this AI knows more about essays than
I do.

## About the data
Successful samples were taken from various online sources. For example, 
there are [John Hopkins essays](https://apply.jhu.edu/application-process/essays-that-worked/),
[CommonApp Essays](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/common-app-essay-examples), and more.

Unsuccessful samples were taken from a wide range of sources. Some were just
random words, put to gether in nonsensical formats. Others were short one-liners,
such as "My grades rule! Let me in to college!" or "My family went to UPen; please
don't make me be a disappointment." Some were even student essays (used with their
permission) that were ok but not great. Also, some were random stack overflow posts
about anything from ice cream to birds.
